# Pre-lecture assignment about heaps

Implement the `max_heapify` method within the Heap class.
Many of the heap operations need to turn an array that is almost a max
heap, except for one element, into a max heap. The max_heapify
operation moves the element at position i into the correct position.

The tree rooted at i is not a max heap, but the subtrees
left(i) and right(i) are max heaps.

Example: 4 is greater than one of its children so we swap it with
the larger child and repeat.
