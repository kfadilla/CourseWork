# Pre-lecture assignment: Trees

The assignment is to implement methods for traversing binary trees.
There are three methods for you to implement in the `BinaryNode` class:
preorder, inorder, and postorder. The `BinaryTreeTest` class includes
one test for each of these methods. Add two more tests (with different trees)
for each of the three traversal methods.
