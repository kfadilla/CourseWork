# Pre-lecture: Dijkstra Shortest Paths Algorithm

Read section 9.3.2 of the textbook (Weiss 3rd ed.) and complete the implementation
of `dijkstra_shortest_paths` in `graphs/Algorithms.java`. There are two helper
functions that you may use: `initialize_single_source` and `relax_edge`.
Also, there is a heap (priority queue) implementation in `sequences/UpdatingHeap.java`
that you may use.

In `StudentTest.java`, the `testDijkstraSeven` method corresponds
to Figure 9.20 in the textbook and is a good place to start debugging.
