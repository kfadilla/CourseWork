# Lab: Generic QuickSort

Implement quicksort in a way that is generic enough that it can be applied to an input 
sequence that is represented as an `Array` or a `LinkedList`.
That is, use the `Iter` interface. Also, the elements of the sequence do not have to
be integers, but instead could be anything that implements the `java.util.Comparable`
interface. Your goal should be to maintain the time complexity of quicksort.
