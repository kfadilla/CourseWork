Project 4: Text Compression

Alice:
The original text has 163675 characters.
The average length of a code is 4.60 bits.
The text is encoded in 752855 bits.
The savings is 556545 bits.
The compressed text is encoded in 94108 characters.
The savings is 69567 characters.
Decompressing yields 752855 bits.
The recovered text has 163675 characters.

All tests passed...
