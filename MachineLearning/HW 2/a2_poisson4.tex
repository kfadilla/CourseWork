\question{10}
Suppose that the number of accidents occurring daily, $x_i$, in a certain plant has a 
Poisson distribution with an unknown mean $\lambda$. So $P(x_i) = \lambda^{x_i} e^{-\lambda}/(x_i!)$.
Based on previous experience in similar industrial plants, 
suppose that our initial feelings about the possible value of $\lambda$ 
can be expressed by an exponential distribution with parameter $\theta=\tfrac{1}{2}$. 
That is, the prior density is
%
\begin{align*}
f(\lambda)=\theta \textrm{e}^{-\theta\lambda}
\end{align*}
%
%
where $\lambda\in (0,\infty)$. 
If there are 79 accidents over the next 9 days, \textbf{determine the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of  $\lambda$}.
